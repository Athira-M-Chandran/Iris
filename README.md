# Iris
#### INTRODUCTION
Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher 
in his 1936 paper. It includes three iris species (Iris setosa, Iris Virginica, Iris versicolor) with 50 
samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly 
separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

Attribute Information is given below:

  1. Sepal length in cm
  2. Sepal width in cm
  3. Petal length in cm
  4. Petal width in cm
  5. Class: (Iris Setosa , Iris Virginica, Iris Versicolor)
  
#### OBJECTIVE
Download Iris dataset from the UCI repository and compare the results of at least two data 
analytics techniques. Here Decision tree ,Random Forest and Naïve Bayes techniques of 
Classification are used for comparison.
#### IMPORTING THE DATASET
